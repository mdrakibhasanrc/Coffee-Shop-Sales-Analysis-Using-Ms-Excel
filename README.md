Implement a loyalty program or offer incentives for large and regular coffee orders to encourage repeat business and increase average order size.

## Leverage Seasonal Trends:
Prepare for higher sales in May and June by planning marketing campaigns, staffing, and inventory in advance. Consider special promotions or events during these months to maximize revenue.
